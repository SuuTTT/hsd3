# RL train


## What is the sample in RL, how to loop a RL learning process
In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), a "sample" usually refers to a tuple of information that describes a single transition in the environment. This typically includes the current state (or observation), the action taken, the reward received, and the next state (or observation). 

The loop `while setup.n_samples < max_steps:` is the main training loop for the RL agent. The condition `setup.n_samples < max_steps` ensures that the agent continues training until it has processed a certain number of samples (`max_steps`). Each loop iteration corresponds to one timestep in the environment.

Here's how the RL process is represented in this code:

1. **Observe the current state:** This is represented by `obs = envs.reset_if_done()`. The agent observes the current state of the environment.

2. **Choose an action based on the current state:** This is represented by `action, extra = agent.action(envs, t_obs)`. The agent uses its current policy to select an action based on the current state.

3. **Execute the action and observe the result:** This is represented by `next_obs, reward, done, info = envs.step(action)`. The agent takes the chosen action, and the environment returns the next state, the reward for the action, and whether the episode is done.

4. **Learn from the experience:** This is represented by `train_loop_mfdim_learner(setup, transition)`. The agent learns from the transition (state, action, reward, next state) and updates its policy or value function accordingly. This could involve many different algorithms, such as Q-learning, policy gradients, or actor-critic methods.

5. **Loop:** The agent repeats this process, continually observing the state, choosing actions, executing them, observing the results, and learning from the experience.

This loop is a standard process in RL, often referred to as the agent-environment interaction loop. It's how the agent learns to perform well in the environment over time.

## concepts

Sure, here's a summary of those terms and their relationships in the context of reinforcement learning:

- **Agent**: This is the entity that is learning and making decisions. The agent interacts with its environment by taking actions, and it learns from the consequences of these actions.

- **Observation**: This is the information that the agent receives from the environment. In the most general case, an observation can be any perceptible information. In fully observable environments like most games or controlled experiments, the observation is usually the current state of the environment.

- **State**: This is a snapshot of the environment at a particular point in time. It's the information used by the agent to decide what action to take. In fully observable environments, the state is equivalent to an observation. In partially observable environments, the agent may need to construct a state representation based on a sequence of observations.

- **Action**: This is a choice made by the agent that affects the state of the environment. The set of all possible actions in a given state is called the action space.

- **Reward**: This is the feedback received by the agent from the environment after taking an action. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time.

- **Transition (or Experience)**: This is a tuple that usually includes the current state, the action taken by the agent, the reward received, and the next state resulting from the action. This forms the basic unit of experience from which the agent learns.

- **Actor**: In an actor-critic style algorithm, the actor represents the policy part of the agent. Given a state, the actor decides which action to take. The actor's job is to interact with the environment, generate transitions, and improve its policy based on feedback from the critic.

- **Learner (or Critic)**: In an actor-critic style algorithm, the learner (or critic) represents the value function part of the agent. The learner's job is to estimate the expected return (cumulative discounted reward) for each state or state-action pair, and to guide the actor to improve its policy. The learner uses the transitions generated by the actor to update its value function and provide feedback to the actor.

The relationships between these components are as follows:

- The agent interacts with its environment by taking actions (decided by the actor), receiving rewards, and making observations.
- The agent (or specifically, the actor) generates transitions by taking actions in the environment and observing the resulting rewards and next states.
- The agent (or specifically, the learner or critic) uses these transitions to update its policy (if the actor's policy is parameterized) or its value function (if the actor's policy is derived from the value function), with the goal of improving the agent's performance in the environment.
- In a single-agent setup, the actor and the learner are often part of the same agent, and the agent alternates between acting (interacting with the environment and generating transitions) and learning (updating the policy or value function based on the transitions).


### agent= learner + actor

Sure, let's represent the relationship between agent, actor, and learner (or critic) in an actor-critic style algorithm in terms of a simple equation:

Agent = Actor + Learner (Critic)

Here's a basic example to illustrate this relationship:

Let's consider an agent learning to play a game, such as chess. 

1. **Actor**: The actor is responsible for making decisions - i.e., deciding which chess move to make given the current state of the chess board. The actor follows a policy, which is a mapping from states (board configurations) to actions (chess moves). Initially, the policy might be random, leading to random moves.

2. **Learner (Critic)**: The critic's job is to evaluate the moves made by the actor. It does this by estimating the value (expected return) of each state or state-action pair. In the context of chess, the critic might estimate the value of a move by considering factors such as the control of the center of the board, the safety of the king, the material balance, etc.

3. **Agent**: The agent combines the roles of the actor and the critic. After the actor makes a move and receives feedback from the environment (the opponent's move and the new state of the board), the critic uses this feedback to update its value estimates. The actor then uses these updated value estimates to update its policy - i.e., to make better moves in the future. The agent continues this process of acting, receiving feedback, and learning from the feedback, with the goal of improving its performance (winning the game).

In this example:

- The **state** is the configuration of the chess board.
- The **action** is a chess move.
- The **reward** might be +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 for a draw or an in-progress game.
- A **transition** includes the current board configuration, the move made, the reward received (if the game ended), and the new board configuration.

This example should provide a concrete illustration of how an agent, and specifically the actor and the critic within the agent, interact with the environment and with each other to learn an effective policy.


The terms "actor" and "learner" are often used in the context of reinforcement learning, particularly when dealing with distributed training setups. Let's look at what they usually mean:

1. **Actor**: An actor is a policy that interacts with the environment. It makes decisions or takes actions based on its current understanding of the environment (its current policy), and then observes the results of its actions. These observations (usually in the form of state, action, reward, next state tuples) are used to update the actor's understanding of the environment. In a distributed setup, there can be multiple actors all interacting with their own instances of the environment and sending their observations to the learner.

2. **Learner**: The learner is the component that takes the observations from the actors and uses them to update the policy. The policy update often involves some form of gradient descent on a loss function that's designed to increase the expected future rewards of the policy. In a distributed setup, there's usually one learner that aggregates the experiences from all the actors, updates the policy, and then sends the updated policy back to the actors.

In the code you provided, the training process is divided between actors and learners, which are running in separate processes. The actors are interacting with the environment and sending their observations to the learner via a queue. The learner is taking these observations, updating the policy, and then broadcasting the updated policy parameters back to the actors.

This separation can make the training process more efficient, especially in environments where collecting observations is time-consuming, as it allows for the collection of observations (acting) and policy updates (learning) to happen in parallel.

> is there still a need of learner and actor?

The need for learner and actor roles in the code depends on the structure of your reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. 

In many RL settings, the agent's role alternates between acting (interacting with the environment to collect experiences) and learning (updating its policy or value function based on collected experiences). 

In your multi-process code, these roles seem to be separated into different processes possibly for parallelization benefits. One or more actor processes could be interacting with the environment and adding experiences to a shared queue, while one or more learner processes could be taking experiences from the queue and using them to update the model. 

When you switch to a single-process setting, you could potentially merge the actor and learner roles into a single function or loop that alternates between acting and learning. However, you still need to maintain the logic for both roles. 

Here's a simplified example of what this might look like:

```python
def train_single_process(cfg):
    setup = setup_training_mfdim(cfg)

    while not done:
        # Perform the actor role
        # Interact with the environment and collect experiences
        # Add the experiences to the queue (or directly to a data structure for experiences)
        act(setup)

        # Perform the learner role
        # Take experiences from the queue (or directly from the data structure for experiences)
        # Update the model based on these experiences
        learn(setup)

    setup.close()
```

In the above example, `act(setup)` and `learn(setup)` are placeholders for whatever code in your `train_loop_mfdim_actor(setup)` and `train_loop_mfdim_learner(setup, setup.queues[rank])` functions implements the actor and learner roles, respectively. 

Remember that this is a simplified example. The exact structure of your training loop will depend on the details of your RL algorithm. You'll need to carefully adapt your code to ensure the single-process version still correctly implements your RL algorithm and achieves the desired performance.

### observation  >= state

The observation indeed usually consists of the current state, the action taken, the reward received, and the next state.

## algorithm


Sure, I'll provide a basic categorization of some advanced Reinforcement Learning algorithms in a table below. Please note that these categories are not strictly disjoint; some algorithms could fit into multiple categories depending on how you interpret them.

| Category | Algorithms |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Value-Based Algorithms** | Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double DQN, C-51, QR-DQN |
| **Policy-Based Algorithms** | REINFORCE, Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) |
| **Actor-Critic Algorithms** | Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) |
| **Model-Based Algorithms** | Dyna-Q, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Model Predictive Control (MPC), MuZero |
| **Hierarchical Algorithms** | Option-Critic, Hierarchical DQN (h-DQN), MaxQ |
| **Multi-Agent Algorithms** | Independent Q-Learning (IQL), Joint Action Learners (JAL), Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), QMIX |

| **Distributional RL** | C-51, QR-DQN |
| **Exploration-Intensive Algorithms** | Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT), Bootstrapped DQN, Noisy Networks |

This table categorizes some algorithms by the major categories we've discussed (value-based, policy-based, actor-critic, model-based), and also by some additional categories that reflect other important aspects of RL algorithms:

- Hierarchical algorithms: These algorithms use a hierarchical structure of policies to handle complex tasks with multiple levels of sub-tasks.
- Multi-agent algorithms: These algorithms are designed for settings where multiple agents are learning and interacting simultaneously.
- Inverse RL / Imitation Learning: These algorithms learn from demonstrations or examples of good behavior, rather than by trial-and-error.
- Off-Policy algorithms: These algorithms can learn from past experiences, stored in a replay buffer, not necessarily linked to the current policy.
- On-Policy algorithms: These algorithms learn from the most recent experiences that are generated by the current policy.
- Partial Observable Settings: These algorithms are designed for settings where the agent doesn't have complete information about the state of the environment.
- Distributional RL: These algorithms aim to learn the distribution of returns, not only the expectation.
- Exploration-Intensive Algorithms: These algorithms implement mechanisms to ensure good exploration of the environment.

This is not an exhaustive list of all RL algorithms, but it should give a good sense of the diversity and range of methods available in the field of reinforcement learning.

 
### actor-critic style algorithm

Actor-Critic style algorithms are a class of reinforcement learning methods that have two components, an Actor and a Critic.

- **Actor**: The Actor is responsible for the policy part of the agent. The Actor decides which action to take given the current state of the environment. This policy is usually parameterized (for example, by a neural network), and the parameters are updated to improve the policy over time.

- **Critic**: The Critic is responsible for the value function part of the agent. The Critic estimates the expected return (cumulative discounted reward) for each state or state-action pair. These estimates are used to guide the Actor to improve its policy.

The Actor and the Critic work together to learn and improve the agent's policy.

Actor-Critic algorithms combine the benefits of value-based methods and policy-based methods. Value-based methods (like Q-learning) learn a value function and derive a policy from it, while policy-based methods (like policy gradients) learn a policy directly. Actor-Critic methods do both: they learn a policy (via the Actor) and a value function (via the Critic).

Regarding the provided code, it does indeed have the structure of an Actor-Critic algorithm. The 'learner' corresponds to the Critic, which uses the transitions generated by the 'actor' to update its value function and provide feedback to the actor. The 'actor', in turn, generates transitions by taking actions in the environment and observing the resulting rewards and next states, and it uses feedback from the 'learner' (Critic) to update its policy. Therefore, this architecture falls into the category of Actor-Critic algorithms.

addition: 

In an actor-critic style algorithm, while the actor is responsible for choosing actions and interacting with the environment, there's also a "critic" component which estimates the value function or Q-function. The critic learns from the transitions generated by the actor and guides the actor to improve its policy.

In a single-agent setup, the actor and the critic are often part of the same agent, and the agent alternates between acting (interacting with the environment and generating observations) and learning (updating the policy based on the observations).


### how learner update policy
The observation indeed usually consists of the current state, the action taken, the reward received, and the next state.

As for the learner, it uses these observations to update the agent's policy. The exact way in which this is done depends on the specific reinforcement learning algorithm being used. Here's a general idea of how this process might work:

1. **Policy Evaluation**: The learner uses the agent's current policy to estimate the expected return (cumulative discounted reward) for each state or state-action pair. This is typically done by sampling a batch of observations from the replay buffer (which stores previously collected observations), and then calculating the estimated returns based on the observed rewards and the current value function or Q-function.

2. **Policy Improvement**: The learner uses the estimated returns to improve the agent's policy. This is typically done by adjusting the parameters of the policy (if it's a parameterized policy such as a neural network) or the Q-function (if the policy is derived from the Q-function, as in Q-learning) to reduce the difference between the estimated returns and the returns predicted by the current policy or Q-function. This is usually done using some form of gradient descent.

In the case of Q-learning, for example, the learner might perform the following steps for each observation in a batch:

1. Compute the target Q-value for the action taken, which is the observed reward plus the discounted maximum Q-value for the next state (according to the current Q-function).
2. Compute the predicted Q-value for the action taken (according to the current Q-function).
3. Update the Q-function to reduce the difference (often measured using the mean squared error) between the target and predicted Q-values.

The exact details can vary depending on the specific RL algorithm and its implementation, and there may be additional complexities such as function approximation (if the policy or Q-function is represented by a neural network), exploration vs exploitation trade-offs, dealing with continuous action spaces, etc.

If the RL algorithm you're using is a form of policy gradient, actor-critic, or deep Q-learning, the above description should give you a general idea of how the learner updates the policy. However, you'll need to refer to the specific algorithm and your code for the exact details.
